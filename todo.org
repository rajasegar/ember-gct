** Problems
- No tests
- Tests in wrong places
- Duplicate tests

** Components
- Find out component tests where we don't need *setupComponentWithMirageTests*
  - Results: Tests will be faster to run
** Mixins

** Routes
- Mock services
- Mock store api
- Find out used model hooks and call them in tests

** Utils
- Scan the util code
- find out all the export named declaration
- write tests for each

** Helpers
- Usage {{helper-name}}
- Usage (helper-name)
- External dependency , service injections
  - Should we go for integration tests?

** Controllers

- Get stats for components without tests
